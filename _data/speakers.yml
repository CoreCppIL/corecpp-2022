  bio: >
    <p>With broad experience in industry, academia, consulting, and research, Dr. Walter E. Brown has been a computer programmer for almost 60 years,
    and a C++ programmer for more than 40 of those years.</p>
    <p>He joined the C++ standards effort in 2000, and has since written circa 175 proposal papers. Among numerous other contributions, he is responsible for
    introducing such now-standard C++ library features as cbegin/cend, common_type, gcd/lcm, void_t, and &lt;cmath&gt;’s mathematical special functions, as
    well as the headers &lt;random&gt; and &lt;ratio&gt;. He has also significantly impacted such C++ core language features as alias templates, contextual conversions,
    variable templates, static_assert, and operator&lt;=&gt; (the C++20 “spaceship operator”).</p>
    <p>When not playing with his grandchildren, Dr. Brown continues as an Emeritus participant in the C++ standards process and as a frequent speaker
    at C++ conferences and meetups worldwide.</p>

  name: "Shachar"
  surname: "Shemesh"
  bio: >
    <p>Shachar began programming when he was 9, and still finds passion in it, 40 years later. At the time, dinosaurs ruled the earth and computers only
    had a grand total of 8 bits. Shachar's career took him to almost every niche that the software world has to offer. Typically, if there was a niche his
    career, for some reason, failed to take him, he'd go there in an open source project. These days Shachar is running two YouTube channels, one in English
    and one in Hebrew, plus an open source project for implementing the computers of his childhood on an FPGA. Rumor has it he also has a day job.</p>
