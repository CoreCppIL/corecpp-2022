  title: "Understanding and Mastering C++ Complexity"
  description: >
    <p>C++ is a very broad language, making it quite natural to have knowledge gaps. Some knowledge gaps are a result of the many additions
    that come with the new versions of C++, but not necessarily, some knowledge gaps may stretch back to C++98.</p>
    <p><b>The goal of this workshop is to cover C++ topics for the intermediate level C++ programmer (with around 1-4 years of experience in C++).</b>
    We would focus on C++ parts that allow you to write better code, more efficient and more efficiently. The workshop would also go through
    important parts of modern C++, from C++11 up to C++20, assuring attendees that mastering C++ is doable.</p>

  title: "Linux Security and Isolation APIs essentials"
  description: >
    <p>This course provides an overview of the low-level Linux features–set-UID programs, capabilities, namespaces, and control groups (v2)–that are used
    to implement privileged applications and build container, virtualization, and sandboxing technologies. (The course does not cover systems such as
    Docker and LXC, but participants will gain an an insight into the implementation and operation of such systems.)</p>
    <p>The primary audience comprises designers and programmers building privileged applications, container applications, and sandboxing applications.
    Systems administrators who manage such applications will also find the course of benefit. Participants should have some awareness of classical
    Linux/UNIX concepts such as file descriptors and file I/O, signals, and the process lifecycle (fork(), exec(), wait(), exit()). In addition,
    participants should have a reading knowledge of the C programming language. (Note, however, that the course exercises do not require writing any programs.)</p>

  title: "Building a compiler (almost) from scratch"
  description: >
    <p>Have you always treated a compiler as magical? Do you want to understand how the compiler actually works? How it transforms code into machine language?
    This tutorial day is a condensed one day course in creating compilers. Well discuss how we parse the code, turn it into semantic constructs, and use those
    to generate actual executable binary. We'll also touch more advanced subjects, such as optimizations and ambiguity. Some of the course will be going over
    the code of an existing (relatively simple) compiler. We'll also discuss tools that help generate compilers and their limitations. You may not be able to
    immediately write your own compiler upon completion, but the tutorial _will_ demystify compiler to the point you will be able to understand how they work.</p>

  title: "Accelerated Modern C++ Tour"
  description: >
    <p>The following hands on tutorial provides a tour of the core modern C++ programming language ideas and core idioms. Many features and examples of the
    language will be shown in an 'accelerated manner', covering the most important features that every C++ programmer should know. Folks who should attend
    this tutorial are those who lack Modern C++ knowledge, or otherwise want a day to reinforce their fundamentals in C++. This will be a hands on workshop
    in which learners will be introduced to each new language feature and as each feature is learned, learners will build from scratch a final project to
    reinforce their knowledge.</p>

  title: "C++ Templates for Developers"
  description: >
    <p>As an intermediate-level C++ programmer, you already know about and have very likely used one or more kinds of C++ templates in your code. Whether you’ve
    applied std::vector or std::array to your work, or called upon any of the multitude of algorithms that the standard library provides, you’ve experienced some
    of the power that templates add to a C++ programmer’s toolkit.</p>
    <p>This Workshop will help you take your knowledge and experience to the next level, so that you will both (1) understand exactly how C++ templates are
    handled by a compiler, and (2) be able to take advantage of that knowledge to create templates that are tailored to your own programming needs.</p>
    <p>In this Academy Workshop, we will explore all significant facets of the many kinds of C++ templates (and other templated entities), and will do so
    in as much depth as our time together will permit. The Workshop will include presentations as well as optional (but recommended) practice exercises,
    together with numerous examples and tips that you can learn from and apply. Many of our examples and exercises will be taken from the standard library,
    thus doubling the useful information you’ll glean from your participation.</p>
    <p>Come discover how the world of C++ templates will open to you once you’ve mastered a modest handful of straightforward, key insights and principles.
    Whether it’s programming generically, or with variadics, SFINAE, concepts, overloading, or other coding practices, this Workshop will allow you to
    explore and apply template-based techniques that will help solve problems in your programming domain!</p>
